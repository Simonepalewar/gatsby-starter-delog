CHAPTER ONE 

Ethan


Oh, I know what you are thinking- The life of being a Agent & having a Twin Brother must be amazing, full on action and telepathic talking with your twin. But, it wasn’t always that way.


I’m also not going to lie to you it was a non-boring life, filled with excitement. There were also some disadvantage of having a twin but, it also meant my brother always has my back if i need something.


My name is Ethan. Ethan Robbins. I’m three years old (yes I’m a Secret Agent and we go to School but, all we learn is rhymes). My parents say I’m a dramatic kid they even said I used to sing myself to sleep and I take it as a compliment, I see myself as a Bookworm. I’ve never been popular at school, my brother was the popular one.

My parent decided to move across the town this summer so we could live in a big house because we were growing. I didn’t mind leaving the town I didn’t have many friends after all but, my brother wasn’t happy at all. In fact he was like an Angry Bird with steam coming out of his ears (that’s not true) But he did seem angry. Very angry.
