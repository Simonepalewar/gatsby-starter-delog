( My first book? Maybe!)



Ethan

Oh, I know what you are thinking- The life of being a Agent & having a Twin Brother must be amazing, full on action and telepathic talking with your twin. But, it wasn’t always that way.

I’m also not going to lie to you it was a non-boring life, filled with excitement. There were also some disadvantage of having a twin but, it also meant my brother always has my back if i need something.

My name is Ethan. Ethan Robbins. I’m three years old (yes I’m a Secret Agent and we go to Pre-school but, all we ever learn is ABCs ). My parents say I’m a dramatic kid they even said I used to sing myself to sleep and I take it as a compliment, I’ve never liked going to Pre-school.

My parent decided to move to a new city this summer so we could live in a big house because we were growing. I didn’t mind leaving this city, I didn’t have many friends after all but, my brother wasn’t happy at all. In fact he was like an Angry Bird with steam coming out of his ears (that’s not true) But he did seem angry.

Ace

One Minute intro before I burst. I’m Ace Robbins, three years old. My twin is Ethan. I am mischief maker of the family, cunning and smart. I learn all the things they teach us with heart (and mind).

And I must tell you that my parents decided to move to another city, but they don’t understand me. I have sooo many friends here! They want me to leave my best friend and my lovely Pre-school and go to a city where I don’t know anyone besides my Cousin- Simone. It doesn’t effect my brother, he is happy to go anywhere because he doesn’t have many friends.

“It will be a great new start, you will have new friends, a bigger room with bunk bed and more space after all, you two are growing up!” Mom said and that was the convincing Ethan needed. Our dad is a Marine Engineer on some ship and he is out on the sea for six months, he is going to come back in a few days. “You don’t understand” I said. Mom chuckled and said “Oh, look at you two cuties learning to speak”  I did say the truth that she doesn’t understand, First she doesn’t understand our language at all and second, she doesn’t understand how is it to leave all the friends behind and go to another city.


After protesting and crying Mom said we had to move, It was hard to change her thoughts once she had made up her mind.


Soon we were in the unknown city and to our surprise, we found out the new big house we were going to livein was only designed. So, we were going to live in our sis’s house with our grandparents.

 It was the first day of school, thanks to the builder the Elementary school and the Pre-school were joined that meant whenever I wanted to meet my she would be there. 


“Welcome to the school” She said in her usual cheery manner, We smiled and entered the school. The school was very modern. Once we were inside the school sis guided us to the Pre-school section, being small kids we only had school half the day and rest of the day we can play inside with toys and explore the playground.I was always curious to explore and see everything. 

The school went smoothly with learning ABCs and rhymes making new friends. When it was time to play nobody was exited more than Ethan, me and a boy. The boy was short, had dark hair. While we were going outside the boy came towards us.

“Hey! You seem new here” the boy said. “Yup we are new here” I replied in our language that grown-ups can’t understand. Soon we found out the boy was Adam with a very outgoing personality and full of chatter.
