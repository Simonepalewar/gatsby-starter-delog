Have you ever wondered is Earth luminous?

No, of course not. Why would you even wonder that? Your teachers have already told you that Earth is not luminous that means does not have it’s own light. But, if you read on i might prove you that Earth is luminous. So, basically there are two points how to prove that Earth is luminous.

First one: This is based on logic. Common logic. Venus is a planet and our teachers say that planet is not luminous, but it is also called “the morning and evening star” because we can see it at morning and evening and ‘star’ because it is reflecting light of the Sun. But star have their own light!
Anyway if we can see Venus shining from here if we were om Venus we would also see Earth shining from there.
The logic is correct and interesting but, My “so techy friend” said that Mars is also visible and the atmosphere is more hospitable as Venus is around 450 Degrees Celsius on one side and -180 on the other. So, the pressure at the surface is too high. Even the solid rock from Earth will get crushed under the pressure and he thinks that the Mars is not so extreme and I should write about it instead of Venus.

The second one is: Forget the part I told you earlier if you want me to prove another way. Now, Earth does emit light. But how?
See, Earth does emit light but only on some period of time which is night time. We the humans live on Earth and need light in night to perform tasks. So the earth from space may look something like the picture above.

And that proves Earth is luminous.(as well as it’s not luminous)

I hope that this blog may have got you thinking.
