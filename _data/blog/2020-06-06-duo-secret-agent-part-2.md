### Ace

“Hey! You seem new here” the boy said. “Yup we are new here” I replied in our language that grown-ups can’t understand. Soon we found out the boy was Adam with a very outgoing personality and full of chatter. He was very keen to hang out with us and know us better, I like him already. He suggested that he could show us around a bit and take us to his favorite play arena.

The play area was full of slides, swings and monkey bars. Me being me raced to the biggest slide and Ethan and Adam followed. The slide was so fast I felt like floating. Just when my feet touched the ground a trap door opened up and we landed in a pile of hay. A robotic voice said "ALERT! ALERT! Intruder! Intruder" 

### Ethan

Me and ace were shivering from the cold, I looked around the room no ACs, how was the room so cold? Plus the hay didn't help at all too. I had so many questions in my mind, where were we? (I know we are in the school, but were?) Where did this hay come from? How was Adam not feeling cold?

"Adam, don't you feel cold?"I asked. Adam didn't reply, "Adam?"Ace questioned. Still no reply. "ADAM!"I yelled. "Uhh, What did I miss??"Adam uttered "Nothing. You were just knocked out for a second" Ace replied cooly but still shivering. Before we could say anything else the room started to fill with babies of our age and older, wearing tuxedoes, ties, sunglasses and holding some type of zapper or gun or a zapper gun and then everything went black, totally black.

I finally woke up, my arms and neck hurt surprisingly didn't hurt and I wasn't on a chair tied with a rope across my legs or something like that with a big villain sitting in front of me and laughing like a madman it was nothing like that. Instead, I was on a very comfy couch in a huge room with a pleasant smell. I looked at my side the A's were waking up too, I chuckled funnily the two boy's name started with 'A' what a coincident I will call them 'The A's ', I hope that will annoy them. I spotted a ladder in a corner, a big one, I looked up. I was right! there is a duct or something like that there. "We can get out of here!!" I suddenly screamed. "Aww man, I was liking it here!" Adam said. "You are surely a strange person" Ace spoke, "Agreed" I replied. 

Before we could talk more the door opened, A  blonde boy of our age walked in followed by a short red-headed girl. "I see you have woken up." The boy said, he continued "Let me introduce myself as we are not allowed to reveal ourself I must say that I am a secret agent, Agent H, highest of the society and this is my assistant, Agent Ruby" He pointed to his left. "Hello" Ruby said. Adam whispered to me "Good name, suits her. Did you get it? she's red-headed with Ruby as her name and ' Ruby' means red jewel! " I replied "Yeah, I know. I'm not stupid!" 

Ruby cleared her throat and said, "We have been observing Adam and we thought that he would be a great addition to our Agency since, Ace and Ethan are also here we may let them go on only one condition, that you may never tell anyone that you both were here." I gulped. Were they threatening us? Agent Ruby continued "We will always keep a watch on you and if you spill the beans...." she waited for it to sink in. Then a thought occurred to me but, there was something off about it. Aaha, got it. It was Ace's voice, it said "Are they bullying us?"
