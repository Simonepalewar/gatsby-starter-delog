#### Ethan

Ruby cleared her throat and said, "We have been observing Adam and we thought that he would be a great addition to our Agency since, Ace and Ethan are also here we may let them go on only one condition, that you may never tell anyone that you both were here." I gulped. Were they threatening us? Agent Ruby continued "We will always keep a watch on you and if you spill the beans...." she waited for it to sink in. Then a thought occurred to me but, there was something off about it. Aaha, got it. It was Ace's voice, it said: "Are they bullying us?" 

Wow, I never thought Ace could transfer his thought to my head. My dream world was broken by Agent H speaking to Ruby "Ruby, We are the good guys not the bad ones. You can't just threaten anyone. Plus, the leader of SAC always wanted to have as many Agents as possible, It won't do any harm if we have two more Agents working for us. They just have to pass the test"

As expected Ace was very excited he started asking questions, mostly dumb once as he does always. "What? Oh wow, Ethan did you hear that we are getting hired by SAC!! Wait, what is SAC? will you pay money? How much? When will we get that cool looking sunglass and the tux? And ooooh test of secrecy, What a cool name! What will we have to do to pass the test? When is the test? do we have to be prepared? At what time? What date? Wait once again, were you spying on Adam?" The last one made him frown.

"Yes, Ethan did hear that he isn't deaf. SAC stands for Secret Agent Company. We can't pay you money because we are kids. You will get the sunglasses, ties and tuxedoes once you prove yourselves worthy of being an Agent. The test is yet to be scheduled for you both, you can be prepared if you want to. We will let you know when is the test. We were not spying on Adam just OBSERVING him." Agent H replied.

"But, Doesn't Adam need to have a test?" I questioned. Ruby replied for Agent H "No, because he has passed our test. We sent bullies after him and he stood up for him and his friends and even made them regret going after him."  "Hey! That put me in a lot of trouble..... But it was worth it" Adam added quickly.

I didn't expect that we would be hired by SAC on the first day of our new School AKA Meadows Pre-School (MPS). It's strange, right? Plus what's more strange is that Agent H answered every question Ace asked. We took the bus from school to home with our sis.  Let me tell you she's not a bit annoying even though she sometimes says that she will take our toys from us if we did that again and we become angry and bite her which happens rarely, okay it happens often you see we are just cute, little monster babies. Our sis is great coming up with ways to entertain us she even lets us comb her hair. 

We reached home and mom asked us how was our school I did a little dance to show her it was great and she laughed at the response. She turned to Ace who was already sitting on the bed telling her the whole story of how he came to the HQ of SAC, Simone (our sis) had put on her face which said- what's he speaking? and was looking like she's gonna burst any moment. Mom burst into giggles causing Simone to laugh.  Ace became furious, he screamed at sis "Do you think its funny? I'm an Agent!" but it only came out like "GOO GOO GAGA!!" He went towards her and quickly and bit her on her right arm before she got a chance to get away "AHHHH" sis let a short screech, as I watched the scene unfold in front of me.
