Hey God,

What's up?  I guess looking at options to teach mankind to treat Earth better. So, I thought that your previous plan of a VIRUS attack will be successful. I know that other kids who have written a letter to you must have wrote-”please tell us a way to escape from covid-19” and blah, blah, blah. But I think I am pleased, annoyed, glad, unhappy and all the synonyms and antonyms of those words which I don't know (as I was not paying attention to the class, please don't tell dad). 

So back to the topic, that I am both pleased and annoyed that we have such a long lockdown and I am here to discuss COVID-19. So, if you see from the good side COVID is making the rivers, air and water clean. People are trying out new things and learning them. Everyone who would say that going out is boring are now wishing that they could go out and play right now. Teenagers that were always talking and going out with their friend are having good family time. So, I was thinking that if this COVID could have made all the Air, Water, Land clean in a few weeks sure it must not be impossible, right! Now think that the lockdown which was super boring for humans is actually heaven for animals, nature and for MOTHER EARTH! So maybe if we can sacrifice a little for Earth, then all the animals, nature wouldn’t have to sacrifice so much for us. So all you have to do is to make sure that all the human beings understand this and then BOOM, you finally could relax and party with me next time God! And if this happens as I proved don’t forget to say thanks!(thank you will also work)
