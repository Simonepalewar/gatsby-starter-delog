Mom burst into giggles causing Simone to laugh.  Ace became furious, he screamed at sis "Do you think its funny? I'm an Agent!" but it only came out like "GOO GOO GAGA!!" He went towards her and quickly and bit her on her right arm before she got a chance to get away "AHHHH" sis let a short screech, as I watched the scene unfold in front of me.

(NEXT DAY AT SCHOOL)
 

The next at the playground Adam came towards us with a glum face "Why the swollen lip?"Ethan asked pointing towards Adam's lips. "Swollen lip? He doesn't have a swollen lip" I answered."Silly, It was meant to be a joke! It means his lower lip looks like it is swollen, but it's not! He is just sad." "Whatever, Adam why are you sad?" I inquired. He said "I am not talking about that. The SAC wants you to know that the test is today at the same place and they want you to report now." "Oh, yessss!!" I shouted on top of my lungs. Ethan frowned "We should be excited but, not too excited. here Adam has a sad face and you are celebrating?". "Yeah. I'm celebrating cant you see? Anyways Adam can use some alone time." I mocked back. Nothing in this whole wide world can upset me. "How about the SAC cancels the test? That will upset you."Ethan spoke. I glared hard at Ethan, does he truly want the test to be cancelled? "Ethan, Can you stop reading my mind? and let's go. You can come unless you don't want to be working with SAC" I said sweetly. "I can never pass the offer of working with SAC" Ethan said.

We were in the Headquarters of SAC, where our test was due. Ruby came in and explained everything we had to know "There will be two tests, both will be easy. the first one you have to watch the video and solve the riddle and the second one will be 'the ball under the cup' and figuring out card tricks. your test shall start now." with that she walked away. A screen lowered and a video started "we will be listening to your answers" Agent H said from behind the glass. 

They were riddles the first one was: There was a spy on the ship and the Captain had three prime suspects, from the sailors. Timothy, 18-year-old: I have just started my work here just a few months ago, and I'm definitely not a spy. Harry, 24-years-old: I can't be a spy, I am too weak for that. I can't even swim!. Sam, 39-year-old: I am not a spy. I have been working here for 13 years. After the captain heard all the statements he quickly figured out who was the spy. who is the spy? The clock was ticking, think fast  Ethan. I slapped my forehead, still no answer.

 "Man, How are we supposed to know? we are not sailors" Ace moaned. "There must be some facts." I told him. "Like what being seasick?" Ace asked running his stupid brain. "No, Ace. Sailors can't be seasick because they will lose their job." I stated. "But what is a sailor who can't swim?" Ace asked. I tried to think of some excuse to deny it as I turned to the video screen. Aaha! "A sailor who can't swim is a spy." I proudly declared. "Great. Got the answer." Ace agreed "Because of me" He added quickly. 

The next riddle was: A man put a hundred dollar bill on the table and when he came back it was gone. at the time there were only three people at the house. the maid, the butler, the gardener. He asked them did they see the note. The maid said: I saw the note and kept it under the book. The butler said: I saw it sticking out of the bottom and kept it between page 11 and 12. The gardener said: I kept it between page 12 and 13. Who took the note?. 

"How are we going to solve it?" Ace moaned. He is always complaining because, he can't solve most of them. As a bookworm, I had a feeling that something is off. I imagined the book in my hand and the note in my other hand. I first kept it under the book then, in the book taking note of the page number. Then I tried to put it in between page 12 and 13 but I couldn't. Guess why.
