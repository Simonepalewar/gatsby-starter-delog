#### Ethan

Mom burst into giggles causing Simone to laugh.Ace became furious, he screamed at sis "Do you think its funny? I'm an Agent!" but it only came out like "GOO GOO GAGA!!" He went towards her and quickly and bit her on her right arm before she got a chance to get away "AHHHH" sis let a short screech, as I watched the scene unfold in front of me.



(NEXT DAY AT SCHOOL)

The next at the playground Adam came towards us with a glum face "Why the swollen lip?"Ethan asked pointing towards Adam's lips. "Swollen lip? He doesn't have a swollen lip" I answered."Silly, It was meant to be a joke! It means his lower lip looks like it is swollen, but it's not! He is just sad." "Whatever, Adam why are you sad?" I inquired. He said "I am not talking about that. The SAC wants you to know that the test is today at the same place and they want you to report now." 

"Oh, yessss!!" I shouted on top of my lungs. Ethan frowned "We should be excited but, not too excited. here Adam has a sad face and you are celebrating?". "Yeah. I'm celebrating cant you see? Anyways Adam can use some alone time." I mocked back. Nothing in this whole wide world can upset me. "How about the SAC cancels the test? That will upset you."Ethan spoke. I glared hard at Ethan, does he truly want the test to be cancelled? "Ethan, Can you stop reading my mind? and let's go. You can come unless you don't want to be working with SAC" I said sweetly. "I can never pass the offer of working with SAC" Ethan said.

We were in the Headquarters of SAC, where our test was due. Ruby came in and explained everything we had to know "There will be two tests, both will be easy. the first one you have to watch the video and solve the riddles and the second one will be 'the ball under the cup'. your test shall start now." with that she walked away. A screen lowered and a video started "we will be listening to your answers" Agent H said from behind the glass.



They were riddles, the first one was: There was a spy on the ship and the Captain had three prime suspects, from the sailors. Timothy, 18-year-old: I have just started my work here just a few months ago, and I'm definitely not a spy. Harry, 24-years-old: I can't be a spy, I am too weak for that. I can't even swim!. Sam, 39-year-old: I am not a spy. I have been working here for 13 years. After the captain heard all the statements he quickly figured out who was the spy. who is the spy? The clock was ticking, think fast Ethan. I slapped my forehead, still no answer.



"Man, How are we supposed to know? we are not sailors" Ace moaned. "There must be some facts." I told him. "Like what being seasick?" Ace asked running his stupid brain. "No, Ace. Sailors can't be seasick because they will lose their job." I stated. "But what is a sailor who can't swim?" Ace asked. I tried to think of some excuse to deny it as I turned to the video screen. Aaha! "A sailor who can't swim is a spy." I proudly declared. "Great. Got the answer." Ace agreed "Because of me" He added quickly.



The next riddle was: A man put a hundred dollar bill on the table and when he came back it was gone. at the time there were only three people at the house. the maid, the butler, the gardener. He asked them did they see the note. The maid said: I saw the note and kept it under the book. The butler said: I saw it sticking out of the bottom and kept it between page 11 and 12. The gardener said: I kept it between page 12 and 13. Who took the note?.



"How are we going to solve it?" Ace moaned. He is always complaining because he can't solve most of them. As a bookworm, I had a feeling that something is off. I imagined the book in my hand and the note in my other hand. I first kept it under the book then, in the book taking note of the page number. Then I tried to put it in between page 12 and 13 but I couldn't. Guess why. Because the pages have two sides. so if the gardener wants to put it in between he won't be able to. "The gardener is the thief" I said loudly. "How?" Ace asked. "My book-loving mind" I said pointing to my brain. "What is a gardener doing inside?" Ace asked. "Stealing" I said. "I never thought that you two would solve the riddle." Agent Ruby said. "Never underestimate anyone" Ace said.

Wow. It felt soo good to say something good. Makes sense to you? Cause it doesn't to me. I didn't even know the meaning of the word-"Underestimate" I just know that it is a famous saying. I was snapped back to reality by Ruby's voice "Now for your next test. The one in which has a ball under one glass and u have to guess which. And there are no rules." "No Rules?" I asked raising my eyebrows. "Well. we have to behave." Ethan said. 

We went to a table with two chairs on one side and a boy sitting on the other side. There were three glasses kept upside-down, there was a small red ball kept on top of the middle one. The boy sitting on the other side kept the ball under the middle glasses, he switches the last glass and the first one and continues to do it with other glasses getting faster and faster. I didn't think any human can be this fast and not mess up. I noticed something, that he was only switching the end glasses, and only switched the middle glasses 4 times.

 "Wait" I said. Surprisingly, He did wait. "Why did u stop?" I ask him. "Now, that's weird. I am a robot, I obey humans and that is my job." Oh, so that was the reason his hand were so fast. "Which glass has the ball?" said the boy. Er... I mean robot, he looks like a boy tho. I looked at Ethan, he looked dazed. So, it was up to me "Umm....the middle one" I said hoping that it is the correct answer. I waited for a moment for him to announce that it was the wrong answer, squeezing my eyes shut and crossed my fingers. "Did I guess the answer?" I asked. 

"Yes, you cracked it," Ruby answered for him. "Phew. I thought it is wrong. And we would never be able to join SAC" Relief flooded through me.
